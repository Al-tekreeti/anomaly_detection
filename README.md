# anomaly_detection

In this project, we detect anomalous behaviors in wireless devices (smartphones and IoT devices) using machine learning techniques. We leverage side effects such as power consumption footprints and network traffic patterns to extract features that can be used to recognize malicious behaviors. We evaluate a large number of statistical metrics using the frequency content of the time series. Then, we extract an effective set of features using principal component analysis (PCA). We cast the problem as a binary classification problem. We use different classification algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), and decision trees (DT). The analysis was done using both MatLab and Python. This repo shows only the Python part of the work as a Jupyter notebook. The work was published in IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSE46696.2019.8984518" class="mw-redirect" title="ISSE 2019">ISSE 2019</a>), Edinburgh, Scotland.
